# Build a web application of your choosing with a team.

## 2. Start working
 
## 3. When your application is complete, you must record a demo of your application as if you were presenting it to potential investors.
  * The video presentation must not exceed 5 minutes
  * The video presentation must cover all the completed features of your application
  * The video presentation must be uploaded to youtube and the link must accompany your code deliverable.
 
## 4. Submit your application + presentation + team assessment before the deadline. 12/4 @ 6:25PM
 
You will be graded on the following categories.
  * Completeness - Did you complete all the proposed features?
  * Functionality - Does your application work well? Are there many bugs?
  * Usability - Does your application look nice? Is it easy to use?
